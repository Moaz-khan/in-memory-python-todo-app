# Tasks: Todo API Backend for Web Applications

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/1-fastapi-todo-api/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan in src/todo_api/
- [x] T002 Create requirements.txt with FastAPI, Pydantic, uvicorn dependencies
- [x] T003 [P] Create __init__.py files for all directories in src/todo_api/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Create main FastAPI app instance in src/todo_api/main.py
- [x] T005 [P] Create ID generator utility in src/todo_api/utils/id_generator.py

- [x] T009 Configure logging in src/todo_api/utils/logging.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create New Tasks via API (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Enable users to create new tasks via HTTP POST requests with proper validation and unique ID assignment

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a POST request to `/api/{user_id}/tasks` with task data and verifying that a new task is created with a unique ID and proper status codes are returned.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - View All Tasks for a User (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Allow users to retrieve all tasks for a specific user via HTTP GET request

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by making a GET request to `/api/{user_id}/tasks` and verifying that all tasks for that user are returned in the response.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P6)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with previous stories but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create TaskCreate Pydantic model in src/todo_api/models/task.py"
Task: "Create TaskResponse Pydantic model in src/todo_api/models/task.py"

# Launch service and endpoint together:
Task: "Implement task creation service in src/todo_api/services/task_service.py"
Task: "Create tasks router in src/todo_api/routers/tasks.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
